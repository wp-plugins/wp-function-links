Use a shortcode to generate clickable links that do NOT pass on link juice in order to boost the link value of the other links on the page.

== Description ==
**The Problem:**

Many website links are not actually links to new or unique content but functions for the visitor. However, because these functions often lead to unique web URLs, search engines allow those “links” to lose link value. Value that is ultimately lost on URLs that produce no inherent value to searchers.

**Types of Functions:**

The following are typical functions that utilize traditional hyperlinks. More often than not, you never want searchers to land on these unique URLs.

*	sort 
*	compare 
*	add to cart 
*	filter 
*	email 
*	email this page 
*	view cart 
*	view account 
*	login 
*	logout 
*	socialize 
*	add to wishlist 
*	review

**The Solution:**

WP Function Links plugin allows you to create clickable hyperlinks on your WordPress site specifically for these types of functions. The plugin creates the ability for you to remove these functions from traditional a href links. The visitor is then able execute the function no differently than before but without it being treated as a link to another URL.  

Since these functions are generally not accessible to most search engine bots it won’t interfere with the search engine spidering processes, allowing the search engines to use their resources following actual links to valuable pages.
